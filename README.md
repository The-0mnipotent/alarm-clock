# Alarm - Clock
Creating a fully functional alarm clock

This repos has three parts :
 - An analog clock : shows time.
 - An alarm : you can create and delete alarm in the clock. It maintains a list of all the alarms you fill.
 - A stopwatch : works just like a regular stopwatch.You can play, pause,reset the clock and also add mark laps in the timer.

All three are created using Date() object in javascript.
